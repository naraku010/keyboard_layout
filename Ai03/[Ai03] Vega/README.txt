ai03's Open Source Plate File Clauses

- The files are provided under the provided license. All license restrictions
  apply, such as absolutely no liability to any issues caused by these files.

- Similarly, I do not guarantee whatsoever that the files are error-free, fully
  functional, and/or guaranteed to not change. The files may be updated and/or
  removed at any point in the future.

- The files are provided as-is, with no tailoring done for any specific means
  of manufacturing, feature, or modification. It is highly recommended to 
  modify the files to suit your exact production method and requirements.

- I do not release the files with the primary intent of supporting large scale
  third party sales. Any sale of products derived from the files must be done
  completely under your own responsibility, including customer support for such
  products. I will not be responsible for any customer support for such third-
  party products, and will not be held liable to guaranteeing compatibility 
  with such products in future revisions of the files.

- I do not release these files with the primary intent of them being used as
  part of another project unrelated to their original purpose, such as fitting
  them into another product. Under no circumstances will I be content with such
  behavior.

- This clause may be updated at any time. The latest version available will 
  apply regardless of which version the files were obtained with.
